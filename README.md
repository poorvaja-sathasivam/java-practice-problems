# Java Programming Problems and Solutions (Practice) 
This repository contains solutions to a variety of Java programming problems and exercises. The purpose is to practice and improve Java coding skills.

Some examples of the types of problems you will find:

- Basic programming exercises (if-else, for loops, arrays)
- String manipulation exercises
- Algorithmic problems (sorting, searching, recursion)
- Object oriented programming exercises (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Data structures exercises (lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
- Multithreading exercises
  
For each problem, you will find:

- A clear description of the problem
- An executable Java solution
- A README file explaining the approach and any assumptions
  
The solutions aim to be:

-Correct
-Efficient in terms of time and space complexity
-Well structured and readable
-Accompanied by relevant unit tests

Fork this repository and improve any solution you think can be made better. Create pull requests with your improvements.

Feel free to suggest additional Java programming exercises you would like to see added!

The goal is for this repository to serve as a practical resource to sharpen Java coding skills. I hope you find it useful!
